### ✨ HELLO HELLO ✨

Let's get started shall we.

I like to create all kinds of random things, I really love seeing some clean code. As you might have noticed there are a lot of repo's on my profile. You can kind of see my learning curve over the past 3 years. 

I have pinnend some of my repo's that I was very proud of at the moment of creating and that have taught me a lot 🤓
Of course not every repo is publicly visible sadly, but secrets are nescesary 🔒

My favourite langauge has to be TypeScript, oh and I've recently found love for Docker 🐋 and Kubernetes 🕸️

### 🎒 My education? 
I have finished a degree in Software development and now I'm doing another Software Engineering study at University.

### ⚡ Fun fact
My biggest project that is currently upcoming is called HvH.gg. It is a fully featured gaming platform where CS:GO players can play against each other without any rules on how to play the game. The stack used for HvH.gg is Nest.JS, ReactJS, Electron, Docker, Kubernetes and SourcePawn.
